#Negative skewness values indicate left-skewness (tail on left side). Positive skewness means right-skew.
#Most of the weird phenology estimates are left-skewed. Many of the largest left (negative) skews are 
#with relatively small sample sizes (n_obs). So it looks like a low sample size and strong negative skew = high risk 
#of offset/duration > 365 days. Larger sample size can reduce overestimation, but left skewness alone can 
#push estimates past 365. We do see some moderate negative skews with moderate n. This suggests that sample 
#size helps but skew can still produce weird estimates. In these cases, the right skew is causing the right 
#tail of the Weibull distribution to stretch past the 365 day mark, leading to overestimation of the offset/
#duration values. In conclusion, overestimation can be caused by: left or right skew, year-round observations,
#and low sample size. Larger sample size can reduce some of the overestimation but not entirely prevent it.

# IN CONCLUSION, just to say it one more time, overestimation is caused by: 

#Left skew – The tail of observations at the start of the year can push the Weibull fit past 365 days.
#Low sample size – Small n makes the model more sensitive to extreme or unevenly spaced observations.
#Year-round activity – Continuous activity with no clear seasonality causes the Weibull to stretch 
#the “season” beyond the calendar year.
#Bimodality with peaks far apart or at the beginning and end of the year – Large separation 
#between peaks creates an artificially long fitted duration.
#Bimodality with year-round seasonality – Even when peaks are moderate, if there’s activity in the
#gaps between them, the model interprets it as a single long season, inflating duration or offset.


# We will now filter out all instances of overestimation, since we know what causes them and have determined
# that this is not an issue with the entire data set and the way we were estimating phenology

#Check that it worked

#Look at new species and grids  
length(unique(phenology_filtered$species)) #54 species 
length(unique(phenology_filtered$family)) #20 families  
length(unique(phenology_filtered$order)) #4 orders
