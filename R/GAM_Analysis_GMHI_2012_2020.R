### Relationships summary: In more urban areas, 

#1   Earlier onset, longer duration: Xylocopa virginica
#2   Later onset, shorter duration: Papilio troilus
#3   Later offset, longer duration: Pyrrharctia isabella, Noctua pronuba

#4   Later onset: Eristalis tenax, Helicoverpa zea
#5   Earlier onset: Eremnophila aureonotata, Vespula squamosa, Clogmia albipunctatus
#6   Later offset: Bombus impatiens, Papilio glaucus, Danaus plexippus, Epargyreus clarus, Phyciodes tharos,
#7                 Battus philenor, Limenitis arthemis 
#8   Earlier offset: Hylephila phyleus, Tetraopes tetrophthalmus
#9   Longer duration: Apis mellifera, Hyproprepia fucosa

# 1-3 make sense, 4-9 make less sense. For example, if onset starts later in the year for more urban areas, why aren't we 
# seeing total duration being decreased in these urban areas as well? If the species starts its season later (and doesn't 
# end later), that would mean less days of activity. But we're not seeing that, so what gives? 

# We need to investigate this. Because flight period duration is derived from the difference 
#between onset and offset, and both onset and offset are estimated from the same observations, 
#their estimation errors can be correlated. This means that even when GHMI significantly predicts 
#onset or offset, the corresponding duration model may not show a significant effect. Let's 
#calculate delta duration by hand as the difference between the predicted offset and onset 
#for high versus low GHMI values: 
#delta duration =(predicted offset at high GHMI − predicted onset at high GHMI) − (predicted 
# offset at low GHMI − predicted onset at low GHMI). 
#This gives us the expected change in duration associated with a change in GHMI, independent of 
#the statistical significance of the duration model itself. By comparing delta duration 
#across species, we can identify cases where onset or offset shifts substantially but 
#duration shows little or inconsistent change, helping to explain the “weird” cases in our models.

### This likely ties into why we saw that for all pollinators as a group, GHMI sig. predicts offset
#   but not onset and not really duration (duration was just barely significant). We'll explore this
#   more carefully here
# Look at variance for the overall models
summary(gam_1)$scale      #duration
summary(gam_1_off)$scale  #offset 
summary(gam_1_on)$scale   #onset
#Offset has lower residual variance (0.3873) than onset (0.4091) and especially duration (0.4720).
#This means the GAM has a clearer signal-to-noise ratio for offset than for duration.

# look at mean and SD of species duration slopes

#Pollinator seasons in more urban areas tend to end later, but the beginning doesn’t shift 
#systematically. This means some species do show longer seasons, but because onset responses 
#vary so much across species, the duration trend is inconsistent overall. That’s why offset is 
#strongly significant, while duration is only weakly significant.

# Cool colors (e.g., blue) might indicate regions where the flight period is earlier or is 
#shorter than average. Warm colors (e.g., yellow/red) indicate later or longer values.The contour 
#lines show where the spatial effect is constant — like elevation on a topographic map.Tight contours =
#spatial effect changes rapidly (i.e., localized hot/cold spots).Broad smooth gradients = gradual
